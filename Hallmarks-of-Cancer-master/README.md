# Hallmarks-of-Cancer
The Hallmarks of Cancer Corpus for text classification

The Hallmarks of Cancer (HOC) Corpus consists of 1852 PubMed publication abstracts manually annotated by experts according to a taxonomy. The taxonomy consists of 37 classes in a hierarchy. Zero or more class labels are assigned to each sentence in the corpus. The labels are found under the "labels" directory, while the tokenized text can be found under "text" directory. The filenames are the corresponding PubMed IDs (PMID).

In addition to the HOC corpus, we also have the [Cancer Hallmarks Analytics Tool](http://chat.lionproject.net/) which classifes all of PubMed according to the HoC taxonomy.
